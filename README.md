# DApps template

This is a DApps template project.
It is a SPA frontend and backend designed to act as a backend for frontend.

Not as usual, I'm here utilizing Redux's flux architecture part, but introducing MVVM design pattern like idea by defining VM with a help of Immutable.js

## How to run

1. install and setup your MetaMask account
2. copy dotenv.exmaple and paste it with name ".env"
3. git clone
4. yarn install
5. yarn dev
6. localhost:3000

You can login with using your private key through MetaMask. This is just a template project so many values are just mocked to let it work.
